## About

### Inspiration and Story

The inspiration for Quiz Master came from our personal experiences with interactive learning. Growing up in Africa, We always valued education but found traditional methods sometimes lacked engagement. We wanted to create a platform that made learning fun and accessible to everyone, no matter their background.

Over the past few months, We dedicated ourselves to developing Quiz Master, balancing our time between studying at Holberton School and working on this project. It's not just an assignment for our portfolio, but a reflection of our journey and growth as a full stack software engineer.
